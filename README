Linguist is a parsing toolkit for parsing context-free grammars (CFGs).

Linguist currently implements the Earley parsing algorithm, although other parsing algorithms could also be
implemented.

Linguist is similar to the excellent Citrus library (https://github.com/mjijackson/citrus), except that Citrus
is an implementation of a PEG (parsing expression grammar) parser instead of an Earley parser.

Linguist doesn't build parse trees yet (that's next on my to do list), it is currently only a recognizer.
